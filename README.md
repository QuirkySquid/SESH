# SESH

A simple audio recording program.

Made this mostly for fun, though I also use it to record my piano practice sessions. You're welcome to use it yourself (at your own risk) or modify it to your content, though please refrain from reuploading this without attribution.

WHAT IS SESH:
A script that allows you to easily record audio files in succession 
with minimal user effort.

HOW IT WORKS:
- Start SESH
- Press space to start recording
- Play song, is recorded into file
- Once completed, press space again to save recording
- Give recording a name, delete recording, or start new recording
